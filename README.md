# Java CodeMaiden
All of my Java lab testing programs and programs I've written for college.

# CodeMaiden
CodeMaiden as a concept was just a location in my brain where I stored stuff related to coding. Now, it is still that, but it's also the name of my Git Repos that I use to learn a new skill or language.
